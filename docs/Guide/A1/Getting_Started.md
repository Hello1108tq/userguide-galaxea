> Congratulations on your new robot and we are proud to invite you to become part of the Galaxea developer community! 
This guide has been carefully crafted to introduce newcomers to the unique beauty and power of Galaxea Robots, 
helping you get started quickly and explore their possibilities to the fullest.
# Getting Started
In this series of step-by-step Getting Started tutorials, 
we will not only lay a solid foundation for using the A1, 
but also guide you through the mechanics and performance of each component.
Together, we will experience and perform a series of exciting demonstrations to unlock the A1's amazing advanced features.

In this first tutorial, 
you will learn how to turn on and operate this intelligent robot and begin your journey of interacting with A1.
## Before You Begin
### Safety
To ensure safe use, it is important to keep in mind that the A1 may cause potential injury under improper operation.
Therefore, we strongly recommend that every user carefully read and follow the instructions in the A1 Safety Guide before operating the robot for the first time to ensure that the operation process is safe and efficient.
### Unboxing
If you need assistance unboxing the robotic arm, please refer to the A1 unboxing video.

### Robot Installation
The installation process of the A1 arm includes securing the arm to the mounting base to ensure its stability and operating accuracy. 
The design of the mounting holes allows the arm to be securely mounted on a variety of platforms, providing flexible mounting options. 
Please select the appropriate installtion platform and fixing method according to the operating environment and usage requirements of the arm to ensure the stability and safety of the arm during operation.

Please refer to the A1 installation video.

### Charging
Before we begin, confirm that all of the packing material has been removed from the robot, and the area around the robot is free and clear from any furniture or obstacles.
To power up the robot, press the On/Off switch found in the base. 
The LED on the switch should illuminate. 
The robot may take 20-30 seconds to fully boot, 
at which point you should hear the Ubuntu startup sound(1) play over the robot speakers.

### Shutting Down
Once you're finished with the work, let's learn how to properly shut down the robot.

## Writing Code
We developed an efficient driver for converting the serial signals through the slave computer and finally released it as a ROS (Robot Operating System) topics. 
This driver not only enables the control of the slave computer, 
but also obtains the feedback information and error codes of the device, 
thus enabling two-way communication and real-time control. 
The tutorials will introduce how to use the programme to develop and operate A1.
You should have:

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS 
- ROS Noetic
  See Developing Tutorials for more information.


## Community Resouces 
While this documentation is the ideal way to get started with your robot, 
there are a number of other resources worth noting that provide additional information and ways to interact with A1 and the larger Galaxea AI community.

### Forum
The user community is vibrant and diverse, and Galaxea AI is committed to fostering communication, 
collaboration and information sharing among all users. To this end, 
we set up an open Galaxea AI Forum as a platform for user interaction. 
On the forum, users are free to ask questions, post project information, 
seek support, or access archives of solved problems. At the same time, our team of engineers regularly reviews and replies to the topics on the forum,
and constantly updates the knowledge base with practical tips and guides to meet the needs of users.

### Github
The vast majority of the code for Galaxea AI products is fully open source and freely available through Galaxea AI's Github platform. 
Users can not only freely browse our code base, but also explore each piece of code in depth to meet your technical curiosity and learning needs.

### Tool Share
One particular Github repo of note is our [Tool Share], which contains open-source tools and accessories that you can use with your A1.

### Community Repositories
All users and explorers can collect some of the open source code developed by our community. 
If you've developed something you'd like to share here, please let us know!

### Community Updates
We are passionate about promoting the outstanding results that continue to emerge in our community!
Every month, we will upload a [Community update], which is widely distributed through the website, 
mailing list and social media platforms, 
with special highlights of exciting recent research projects completed by A1 clients. 
When your work is ready for public display, 
please let us know and we will share this honor with the entire community to ensure that your work gets the attention and appreciation it deserves!

## Getting Help
If you run into any issues or find yourself in need of additional resources while developing with A1, 
we want to hear from you!

### Forum
One of the best parts of working with A1 is the active and helpful user community. 
We encourage all our users to make use of the Galaxea AI Forum, 
where you can post your own questions or search an archive of resolved issues. 
Our engineers regularly read and respond to threads here, as well as posting helpful tips and tricks in the Knowledge Base.

### Support
If you've run into a hardware problem, need urgent assistance, 
or just can't find the answer to your questions and want to chat directly with a Galaxea AI engineer, 
please feel free to contact us directly at [support@galaxea.ai](mailto:support@galaxea.ai).
We love talking to A1 users, and your feedback helps us improve the product for all our users. 

### Next Steps
This concludes the guides in our Quickstart tutorial. 
We recommend continuing to learn about A1 in one of the following sections:
