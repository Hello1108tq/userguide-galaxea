> Congratulations on your new robot and we are proud to invite you to become part of the Galaxea developer community! 
This guide has been carefully crafted to introduce newcomers to the unique beauty and power of Galaxea Robots, 
helping you get started quickly and explore their possibilities to the fullest.
# Getting Started
In this series of step-by-step Getting Started tutorials, we will not only lay a solid foundation for using A1, 
but also guide you through the mechanics and performance of each component. 
Together, we will experience and perform a series of exciting demonstrations to unlock A1's amazing advanced features.

In this first tutorial, <u>you will learn how to turn on and operate this robot arm</u> and begin your journey of interacting with A1.

## Before You Begin
### Safety
To ensure safe use, it is important to keep in mind that A1 may cause potential injury under improper operation. 
Therefore, we strongly recommend that every user carefully read and follow the instructions in 
Safety Guide before operating the robot for the first time to ensure that the operation process is safe and efficient.

### Unboxing
Upon opening the package, you will find the robot arm as a fully assembled unit. 
This means that the arm structure, including all its links and joints, 
comes pre-assembled and ready for installation. Here’s what you can expect inside the box:

### Installing Robot
The installation process of A1 includes securing the arm to the mounting base to ensure its stability and operating accuracy. 
The design of the mounting holes allows the arm to be securely mounted on a variety of platforms, 
providing flexible mounting options.

Please select the appropriate installtion platform and fixing method according to the operating environment 
and usage requirements of the arm to ensure the stability and safety of the arm during operation.

If you need assistance installing the robot arm on a base, please refer to A1 installation video.

### Charging
Before we begin, confirm that all of the packing material has been removed from the robot, 
and the area around the robot is free and clear from any furniture or obstacles.

To charge A1, please use the cable provided with the device and plug it into the charging port where the rated voltage is 48V.

### Shutting Down
In the event of an emergency where the normal shutdown procedure cannot be followed, 
proceed to disconnect the power cable from the power supply to immediately halt the robot arm's operation.

### Emergency Stop
The power supply unit of the robot arm includes an emergency stop switch button (E-stop) for immediate power 
interruption during emergencies. Pressing the E-stop button will instantly disconnect power to the robot arm,
ensuring operator safety and preventing damage to the equipment.
