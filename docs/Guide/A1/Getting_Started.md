# Getting Started
Over the course of these Getting Started tutorials, 
we will explore the basics of working with A1, get familiar with all of its joints and sensors, 
and run some exciting demonstrations of some of more advanced features of A1. In this first tutorial, 
we'll learn how to turn on the robot and use it.
## Before You Begin
### Safety
A1 has the potential to cause harm if not properly used. 
We recommend that all users review the A1 Safety Guide before operating the robot.
### Unboxing
If you need assistance unboxing the robotic arm, please refer to the A1 unboxing video.
### Installation
The installation process of the A1 arm includes securing the arm to the mounting base to ensure its stability and operating accuracy. 
The design of the mounting holes allows the arm to be securely mounted on a variety of platforms, providing flexible mounting options.  
Please select the appropriate installtion platform and fixing method according to the operating environment and usage requirements of the arm to ensure the stability and safety of the arm during operation.


Please refer to the A1 installation video.

## Powering Up
Before we begin, confirm that all of the packing material has been removed from the robot, and the area around the robot is free and clear from any furniture or obstacles.
To power up the robot, press the On/Off switch found in the base. 
The LED on the switch should illuminate. 
The robot may take 20-30 seconds to fully boot, 
at which point you should hear the Ubuntu startup sound(1) play over the robot speakers.

## Safety Features
Before we start operating A1, 
there are two features that are important to understand for the safe use of the robot - the Runstop button and the battery indicator lightbar.

## Shutting Down A1
Once you're finished with the work, let's learn how to properly shut down the robot. 

## Charging Basics
Stretch contains two 12 sealed lead-acid (SLA) batteries. 
For the health of your robot, is is important to keep Stretch charged and not to let the battery voltage run down too low. 
It is good practice to plug in Stretch whenever you are not using the robot - the charger will automatically maintain the batteries and keep them topped off and healthy.

Stretch comes with a NOCO Genius10 battery charger with a custom cable. 
Unbox this charger and set it next to the robot. Plug the charger into the wall, 
then attach the other end to the robot's charging port.
