To power up the robot, press the On/Off switch found in the base.  The LED on the switch should illuminate.  The robot may take 20-30 seconds to fully boot,  at which point you should hear the Ubuntu startup sound(1) play over the robot speakers.</p>"},{"location":"Guide/A1/Getting_Started/#safety-features","title":"Safety Features","text":"<p>Before we start operating A1,  there are two features that are important to understand for the safe use of the robot - the Runstop button and the battery indicator lightbar.</p>"},{"location":"Guide/A1/Getting_Started/#shutting-down-a1","title":"Shutting Down A1","text":"<p>Once you're finished with the work, let's learn how to properly shut down the robot. </p>"},{"location":"Guide/A1/Getting_Started/#charging-basics","title":"Charging Basics","text":"<p>Stretch contains two 12 sealed lead-acid (SLA) batteries.  For the health of your robot, is is important to keep Stretch charged and not to let the battery voltage run down too low.  It is good practice to plug in Stretch whenever you are not using the robot - the charger will automatically maintain the batteries and keep them topped off and healthy.</p> <p>Stretch comes with a NOCO Genius10 battery charger with a custom cable.  Unbox this charger and set it next to the robot. Plug the charger into the wall,  then attach the other end to the robot's charging port.</p>"},{"location":"Guide/A1/Getting_Started/#troubleshooting","title":"Troubleshooting","text":"<p>If you're having trouble with the steps in the guide, please check the following tips:</p>"},{"location":"Introducing_Galaxea_Robot/product_info/A1/","title":"A1","text":""},{"location":"Introducing_Galaxea_Robot/product_info/A1/#product-infromation","title":"Product Infromation","text":"<p> A1 is an ultra-lightweight force-controlled robotic arm featuring high dynamics and large loads.
